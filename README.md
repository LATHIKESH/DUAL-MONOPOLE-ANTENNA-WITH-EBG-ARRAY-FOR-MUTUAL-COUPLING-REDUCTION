## Abstract
This project explores a technique to reduce mutual coupling in UWB MIMO antennas using a small-sized uniplanar EBG. The design features two circular monopole radiators with a ground plane slot for impedance matching. A 6.8 mm × 6.8 mm UC-EBG cell enhances isolation in a 4 × 1 array. The antenna, on a 1.6 mm FR4 substrate, exhibits -10 dB impedance bandwidths of 14.6 GHz (3-17.6 GHz) and 14.8 GHz (3.6-17.9 GHz) in simulation and measurement. UC-EBG achieves isolation better than -18 dB over the impedance bandwidth.
## Introduction
As data rates continue to increase, Ultra-wideband antennas (UWB) have become increasingly popular and widely accepted. They offer low power consumption, high data rates, and affordability, making them an excellent choice for high-speed wireless communication systems. UWB antennas are utilized in various applications, such as GPS, remote sensing, and Direct Broadcast System (DBS). The FCC has allocated a frequency range of 3.1–10.6 GHz for UWB systems, transmitting low-power signals over a vast bandwidth.

The most commonly used antenna for UWB systems is the microstrip antenna due to its planar and compact geometry, immunity to multi-path interferences, and near-omnidirectional radiation pattern. The omnidirectional radiation pattern enables freedom in the orientation of transmitter and receiver antennas, ensuring reliable communication.

To increase system capacity, the high bandwidth of UWB antennas can be efficiently utilized by employing Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) antennas. MIMO antennas use multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver sides to counter the effects of multipath fading, improving link reliability and spectral efficiency. MIMO antennas transmit power using multiple antennas at the transmitter, supporting high data rates and increased channel capacity without sacrificing additional power. Several configurations have been proposed in the literature for realizing MIMO antennas.

UWB MIMO antennas are highly desirable for portable devices supporting various wireless telecom standards and services. In close proximity, MIMO antenna elements can affect each other through near-field coupling, significantly affecting system performance, especially in the lower UWB band. The inter-element spacing is optimal to reduce coupling effects, posing a minimum limit on the antenna size. Decoupling structures are desired between the radiators to maintain optimum performance and reduce inter-element spacing.

Researchers have proposed several techniques to increase decoupling between elements, such as defected ground structure (DGS), neutralization lines, stubs, decoupling and matching networks, parasitic structures, electromagnetic band gap (EBG) structures as a decoupling array, or EBG as a substrate. Compact MIMO antennas achieving wideband isolation have been demonstrated using tree-like structures, meandered lines, and orthogonal radiation modes. A compact double-sided UWB MIMO antenna has achieved isolation by decoupling structures. EBG structures can be mushroom-like or uniplanar, and their use has been shown to reduce E-plane coupling. UC-EBG super states have also been demonstrated for reducing mutual coupling in patch antenna arrays.

### Objective
This project presents a method for reducing mutual coupling between elements of a UWB MIMO antenna using a small-sized uniplanar EBG. The proposed UWB antenna design includes two circular-shaped monopole radiators with a ground plane slot for proper impedance matching. A 6.8 mm × 6.8 mm UC-EBG cell is inserted between the antenna elements in a 4 × 1 array configuration to improve isolation. The UCEBG's band gap is determined using dispersion diagrams and suspended strip line methods. The antenna is fabricated on a 1.6 mm thick, low-cost FR4 substrate with an overall size of 27.2 mm × 46 mm and has been experimentally verified. The antenna demonstrates simulated and measured -10 dB impedance bandwidths of 14.6 GHz (3-17.6 GHz) and 14.8 GHz (3.6-17.9 GHz), respectively. The UCEBG structure exhibits multiple stop bands and suppresses E-plane coupling over these bands, achieving isolation better than -18 dB over the complete impedance bandwidth. The radiation efficiency and peak gain of the antenna vary from 78% to 96.7% and 1.4 dB to 4 dB, respectively. MIMO parameters such as error correlation coefficient (ECC) better than 0.018 and Total active reflection coefficient (TARC) better than -26 dB are achieved over the impedance bandwidth.

## Existing System

### Mutual Coupling reduction using 2D-EBG Array structure
Reducing mutual coupling is a key research area in the design of compact microstrip antenna arrays. To minimize the overall size of the antennas arrays, the distance between them must be very small, as a result, strong mutual coupling appears. Periodic structures can help to design a low profile of antennas arrays and enable improving their performances by the suppression of surface waves propagation in a given frequency range. This paper proposes a novel configuration of mushroom-like electromagnetic band-gap (2D-EBG) structure created by microstrip technology placed between two antennas arrays to reduce the mutual coupling by more than -33.24 dB. When 13×2 EBG structures are used, the mutual coupling reduces to -59.36 dB at the operation frequency 5.8 GHz of the antennas arrays. A 26.12 dB mutual coupling reduction is achieved, proving that the surface wave is suppressed.

### Mutual Coupling Reduction using UC-EBG Array
The fast development in electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) structures; various configurations of EBG structures have been successfully applied in the patch antenna arrays to improve array characteristics, such as total size and radiation efficiency. Nowadays, an important challenge in the communication industry is to reduce the total size of devices. Placing elements of an antenna array close to each other is obviously one way to reduce the total size of an array; as a result, strong mutual coupling appears. Some conventional structures have also been proposed to reduce the mutual coupling between the radiating elements of microstrip antenna arrays such as cavity-backed and substrate removal microstrip antennas. The final results show a 10-dB reduction in mutual coupling and a 0.13 lambda reduction in size compared to the initial array structure.

### High Mutual Coupling Reduction using Novel structure
A novel parasitic configuration to reduce the mutual coupling between two adjacent microstrip patch antennas is shown that mutual coupling between the antenna elements can be reduced significantly by two simple slots structure on the ground plane and several shorted simple conducting strips between patch antennas. The results are shown that more than 7 dB reduction within the operational frequency bandwidth with the maximum 41 dB mutual coupling at the center frequency can be achieved and proves the high efficiency of this configuration in multi-antenna systems.
